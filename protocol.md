## <span style="color:black"> __Types of Databases__ </span>
<span style="color:grey">
<span style="color:black"> 1-SQL database (relational databases) features: </span> 
 
A relational database is table-oriented where every bit of data has a link with every other bit of data.It has a row-based table structure which connects related data elements.
* use flexible queries to access data
* use queries that span mutliple tables
* enforce certain constraints on your data
* well documented access language (SQL is ISO standardized)
* examples: PostgreSQL, Mysql, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle...

 
2-NoSQL database features:
A NoSQL database uses a variety of formats, such as documents, graphs, wide columns, etc, which offers great flexibility and scalability to a database design. 

Note: NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL
* when your access patterns are known beforehand and simple
* when data model fits (facebook connections graph)
* when you need flexible data storage/need to avoid constraints (NoSQL databases are schemaless)
* when you need low latency and easy horizontal scaling (ex: Apple has a 75,000-server NOSQL 
  database!)
* examples: Cassandra, MongoDB, HBase, DynamoDB

## <span style="color:black"> __Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database
Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database and run queries
Examples of famous RDBMS are PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server (aka “dialects” or “flavors”)
* Database Server
A database server is a computer which uses a DBMS that provides database services to other computers, as defined by the client–server model
Users access a database server through a client program running on the user's computer
To access the database server, you need the following:
the database server's host IP address (a.k.a DB end-point, this can be the local host if the DB is local on our machine)
Username 
Password
Port number (depends on the DBMS)
Database name (because there can be multiple databases on the same server)

## <span style="color:black"> __Taking Good Notes__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">

* stick to one style, e.g. links are in italic, keywords are in bold, dividers inbetween topics, etc.  
* don't vary your text style too much, keep it simple
* use bold and italic words rarely so they stand out more

</span>

## <span style="color:black"> __Code inside notes__ </span> 
You can insert blocks of code into your notes with Markdown by wrapping the code in backticks (\`)
\`/from x import y\` becomes  
`/from x import y`
